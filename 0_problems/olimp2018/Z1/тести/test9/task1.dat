Petrik decided to encode messages for his best friend Tarasik. He wrote this message in one sentence. It consists of words that are sequences of alphanumeric characters or symbols. Separate words are separated by an arbitrary number of spaces or punctuation marks (,), dashes (-), colons (:), or their arbitrary combinations. The sentence ends with one of the punctuation marks: a dot (.), An exclamation point (!), A question mark (?). The sentence can not be empty, that is, it contains at least one word. The length of the sentence is considered unlimited. The number of words in a sentence is the number of new books that Petriku presented, and the number of characters in the longest word - the number of new eBooks that appeared in the collection of Petrik.
Set the total number of words in the sentence and find the greatest length of the word.
